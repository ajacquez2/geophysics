# code academy has showned me useful simple unix commands that i can use towards research applications. I have already been using unix for trying to process my data for my proposal and these tutorials are just what I needed to get started.
$ls is to list directory
$pwd is to print working directory 
$clear to erase previous work
$cat is to create new files
$Cd is to change directory
I have already used these simple command to install promax and seismic linux on my MAC and have already started looking at my data.
